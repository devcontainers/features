## Licensing

On August 10, 2023, HashiCorp announced a change of license for its products, including Terraform. After ~9 years of Terraform being open source under the MPL v2 license, it was to move under a non-open source BSL v1.1 license, starting from the next (1.6) version. See https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/main/LICENSE

## OS Support

This Feature should work on recent versions of Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions with the `apt` package manager installed.

`bash` is required to execute the `install.sh` script.
